Hey all,

Here are a few things to do to prepare for Thursday's class:

1) If everyone could install the BioGeoBEARS package before thursday's class following the instructions I have linked: http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears

2) Briefly go through Ree and Smith 2008 to get a feeling for the DEC model implemented in Lagrange and BioGeoBEARS: https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/57/1/4/1703014

3) Briefly go through Matzke 2013 to familiarize yourself with the DEC+J model: https://escholarship.org/content/qt44j7n141/qt44j7n141_noSplash_a25fcfcd2e4c86c599d6f7da5ee1d7f8.pdf

Thanks,
Ethan
