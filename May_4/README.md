# May 4 Modeling of Rat Lung Worm  

## Randi Rollins

I will present a component of my recent research, focused on the prevalence and intensity of rat lungworm infection in its intermediate host species across an environmental gradient. This research was recently published:

[Rollins et al. 2021](Rollins2021.pdf) Host snail species exhibit differential Angiostrongylus cantonensis prevalence and infection intensity across an environmental gradient
[Medeiros et al. 2020](Medeiros2020.pdf) Species Identity and Size are Associated with Rat Lungworm Infection in Gastropods

Dr. Butler's course inspired me to analyze my data on a finer scale in hopes of understanding what drives the patterns of human rat lungworm infection, and the resulting disease, angiostrongiliasis (eosinophilic meningitis), in Hawaii. Although human cases have been reported statewide, the majority of cases occur in the Puna/Hilo region of the Big Island. I am combining the SEIR modeling techniques we explored over the semester with Agent Based Modeling to hopefully understand why human rat lungworm cases occur in such high numbers in the most southeastern region of the state of Hawaii. 

The platform I am using is NetLogo. This is an open source platform for Agent Based Modeling. You can access the NetLogo homepage and run it through your [web browser here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) or you can [download NetLogo here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml). I also played with COVID-19 modeling, and will show you this as well.

The programming language used is Scala, with a bit of Java. But don't worry! It is user friendly :)
