I have created 2 directories:
	-test_hawaii
	-test_italy
	
In the "test_italy" directory there is a script called "italy_test.R" that follows an example inferring transmission dynamics of the infection in italy.

In the "test_hawaii" directory there is a script called "hawaii_test.R" that attempts to adapt that analysis to the Hawaii data. There is also a "Hawaii_test2.R" that attempts to do with with daily cases instead of total cases. I am currently a little stumped on this one, I cannot read the data into the model (it's probably super easy but I cannot think of it right now).

Feel free to work with them and see what you can add.
