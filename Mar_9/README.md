# Mar 9 Hawaii Mathematical Modeling of Vaccination  

## Guest Lecture by Monique Chyba at 10:30am

Monique Chyba and team will talk to us about the work her group has been doing to model COVID-19 spread in Hawaii and their recent models incorporating geography and vaccination.   

They have a fantastic lineup:
* Introduction to modeling and what it can do for the pandemic (M. Chyba)
* Data collection (Alan and Winnie)
* The compartmental model (Prateek)
* Demonstration of observables (Yuri)
* Agent based models, COVASIM, and introducing vaccination (Sasha)
