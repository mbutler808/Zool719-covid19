# Mar 2 Adaptive Immunity and why mRNA vaccines are expected to be better  

## Guest Lecture by Howard Shen at 10:30am

Dr. Howard Shen will give us a "crash course" on how our adaptive immunity works to better understand how vaccines work, and why the new mRNA vaccines are potentially much more effective.
